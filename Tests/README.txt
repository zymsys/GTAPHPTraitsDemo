The files in this folder test questions I had while learning traits.  These
were tested against PHP 5.4 Alpha 1 and results may change before the final
release.

Constructors.php: Can constructors be placed in traits?  If so, is the older
style where the class is named the same as the method also be used?  What
about destructors?

Can I hold state in a trait, or just methods?

State1.php: Can application wide state be stored in static properties?

State2.php: Can traits define properties for class instances?
